# CHESs_Go

The Nega max algorith with alpha beta prunning have been implemented here. It is a quite greta algorithm against most human player. But here we see that random Player was able to draw the match which is quite surprising. This is because Nega max algorithm is basically a min Max algorithm, it assumes that hen  move is made the opponent will make its best move and calculates the further outcome and generates its own move. Nut with random player the opponent is not making its best move, the the algorithm fails to win in many cases.
This can be a fatl error for nega Max algorithm.
